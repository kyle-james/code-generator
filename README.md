# code-generator
Java based code generator I created to manually fill databases quicker.

Explanation:

The program is simply a .jar. If everything runs perfectly, the intial running of the jar will generate 3 files. 'code_in.txt', 'code_out.txt', 'lines_in.txt', and 'app.config'.

app.config contains some simple configurations (As well as a boolean configureation which is not yet implemented), like which seperators you want (Default is ','),
which variable denotations you want (default is a '@' wrap. use '@' as you would quotes, in code_in.txt)

lines_in.txt is where all of your data entry will take place.

code_in.txt is where you will create the 'lines' of code you want each line in lines_in.txt to create. it's a difficult concept to put in words.

use it how you want it.
